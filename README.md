playingWithCurveship
====================

I clearly have no idea what I'm doing.

In order to run the files in here, you must have/utilize/etc: https://github.com/nickmontfort/curveship/

For example, take gabbyattempt.py and shove it into the fiction folder. Then using terminal, do...

python curveship.py fiction/gabbyattempt.py

OR, using commandline, do...

python curveship.py fiction\gabbyattempt.py

Enjoy, I suppose!
